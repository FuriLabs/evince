Description: document (postcript, pdf, dvi) viewer
 It's designed to be a simple multi-page document viewer, it has support
 for thumbnails and bookmarks right now. Zooming, search, clipboard and
 most other functions are working or coming along since it is still very
 much at the early stages of stability.
